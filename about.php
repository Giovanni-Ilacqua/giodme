                    Hello! My name is Giovanni, but my friends often call me Giodme.
                    I am 21 and I am a Computer Science major at the University of Rochester.
                    I am also a Level 2 certified Fitness Instructor and I have been training for more than 6 years.
                    I really love fitness and I am super passionate about helping others achieve their fitness goals.

                    <h3>HOW I GOT STARTED</h3>
                    <p>
                        My passion for fitness started when I was 15. At that time I was very thin but I desired to get
                        stronger and improve my body, so I started boxing.
                        I truly liked the sport but I enjoyed even more the physical conditioning behind it and I eventually
                        transitioned to only doing weight training in the gym.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As I gained experience and transformed my body I discovered I also really enjoyed teaching other
                        people about fitness! I was always eager to lead workouts with friends and give them tips on how to
                        get more effective trainings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My interest for fitness also led me to explore the world of calisthenics training. I was very
                        fascinated by the idea of training using only your body, with minimal equipment.
                        Nowadays my favorite method of training is Calisthenics.
                        There is something special about being able to workout anywhere you are!
